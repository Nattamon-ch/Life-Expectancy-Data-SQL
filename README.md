# Life-Expectancy-Data-SQL
"Life-Expectancy-Data-SQL" project leverages SQL to delve into global life expectancy trends, analyzing various health indicators and regional data. It features SQL scripts for database setup, comprehensive documentation, and insights into life expectancy influences, designed for public health researchers and data analysts.

# Life-Expectancy-Data-SQL

## Project Overview
This repository hosts a comprehensive SQL database project aimed at analyzing global life expectancy data. It includes SQL scripts for database setup, CSV data files on various life expectancy metrics, and extensive documentation on methodologies and findings.

## Data Description
The project utilizes multiple CSV datasets (`HALElifeExpectancyAtBirth.csv`, `WHOregionLifeExpectancyAtBirth.csv`, etc.) to explore factors affecting life expectancy worldwide. These datasets are organized under the `data` folder for easy access.

## SQL Database Structure
- `Life_Expectancy.sql`: Core SQL script for creating the database schema.
- Additional SQL scripts within `Database for Life Expectancy.zip` detail further database enhancements and data insertion commands.

## Documentation
- `Life_Expectancy_Data_Analysis_SQL_Documentation.docx`: Contains a full breakdown of the project's objectives, database schema, data analysis processes, and key insights.

## Getting Started
To utilize this database:
1. Set up a SQL server and execute the SQL scripts to create your database.
2. Import the CSV data files as instructed in the documentation.
3. Review the documentation for detailed analysis and insights.

## Tools Used
- SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or similar)
- Data analysis tools as preferred (e.g., Python with Pandas for supplementary analysis)
